# HealthProcessing
Apple health metrics processing. 

In https://github.com/FergusCurrie/health_database I created a parser for the apple health data export which stored my data in MySQL. This repo will query from MySQL and generate some visulisations of different metrics like sleep, stepcount and heart rate.
